# Introduction to Polony Counter

Welcome to the documentation for the Polony Counter project! This tool is designed to revolutionize the way viruses are quantified in marine water samples, offering a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution for researchers and scientists in the field of marine biology and virology.

## What is Polony Counter?

Polony Counter is a cutting-edge protocol developed initially for sequencing purposes and later adapted for quantifying specific types of viruses in marine water. This protocol, refined by Lindell's Lab at Technion, Haifa, Israel, extends beyond mere virus counting; it provides detailed insights into the quantity of viruses at a type/clade level in any given sample.

## Project Overview

The traditional process of analyzing marine water samples using the Polony Counter protocol is time-consuming, typically taking about 2.5 days for 20-30 samples. This process involves two main phases:

1. **Molecular Biology Work:** A four-day laboratory procedure encompassing various molecular biology techniques to prepare samples.
2. **Polony Counting:** Post-lab work where high-resolution images of prepared slides are analyzed to count polonies â€“ distinct points that appear in red, green, and yellow.

## Our Goal

Our mission is to automate and streamline the polony counting process. This automation aims to reduce the manual, labor-intensive counting, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of virus quantification in marine water samples.
